## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

- What is tensorflow?
- What is a session? graph?
- What are tensors?
- What are variables? constants? placeholders? How do you use them?
- What are operations? How do you use them?
- What are namespaces? How do you use them?
- How to train a neural network in tensorflow
- What is a checkpoint?
- How to save/load a model with tensorflow
- What is the graph collection?
- How to add and get variables from the collection

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
- Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15) and tensorflow (version 1.12)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import tensorflow as tf
- You are not allowed to use the keras module in tensorflow
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
